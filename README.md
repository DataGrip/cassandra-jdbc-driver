# Cassandra JDBC Driver

This is an open source JDBC Driver for Cassandra used inside [DbSchema Database Designer](http://www.dbschema.com)
Using this driver we make possible to present Cassandra interactive diagrams, relational data explorer, visual query builder, random data generator, forms and reports and many other tools.

The driver implements a PreparedStatement where native Cassandra queries can be passed.
The result will be returned as ResultSet with one column containing the Map JSon object.

Any contributions to this project are welcome.
We are looking forward to improve this and make possible to execute all Cassandra native queries via JDBC.
